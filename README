This program takes two command line argument.
First argument is the input file for trace.
Second argument is the ouput file for effectiveness of various cache subsystem organizations.

This program consists of following cache subsystem organizations:
1. Direct-Mapped Cache (64-bytes cache line)
   -  with 5 different cache size (4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 32KB, and 64KB)
2. Set-Associative Cache (64KB cache with 64-bytes cache line)
   -  with 4 different associativity (2, 4, 8, and 16)
   -  all of them use least recently used (LRU) replacement policy
3. Fully-Associative Cache (64KB cache with 64-bytes cache line)
   -  with 2 different replacement policy (LRU and Random)
4. Set-Associative Cache with no Allocation on a Write Miss (64KB cache with 64-bytes cache line)
   -  with 4 different associativity (2, 4, 8, and 16)
   -  all of them use least recently used (LRU) replacement policy
   
Output file is formatted accordingly:
# # # # #	// 1.
# # # #		// 2.
#			// fully with LRU
#			// fully with random
# # # #		// 4.
